## About Rentoro

Rentoro is a web-based peer-to-peer car rental platform that connects car owners with renters in Rwanda. The platform provides a convenient, affordable, and secure way for people to rent cars while enabling car owners to earn money from their idle vehicles.

### Why Rentoro?

- The car rental industry in Rwanda is dominated by traditional companies with high prices and rigid policies.
- Many car owners have vehicles that remain unused for extended periods.
- There is no simple, community-driven platform that allows car sharing in Rwanda.
- Rentoro bridges this gap by offering an easy-to-use, safe, and efficient solution.
